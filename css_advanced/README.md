- Apply CSS styling to match the provided Figma design file.
- Ensure all code is clean, well-structured, and W3C-validated.
- Adhere to best practices in web development.

## Designer File

Access the designer file on Figma:
- [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/files)

### Notes for Figma:
- Ensure all fonts are installed:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
